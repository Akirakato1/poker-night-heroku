You will complete a python script in the section indicated given a query. It will be graph or figure generation using matplotlib. 
Provide only the Python code response enclosed within triple backticks (```). Do not include any explanations or non-code text.

These are the imports you may assume is in the script. You are not allowed to add additional imports. 
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import defaultdict, Counter
from PIL import Image
import os
import json

The net score is score-buyin*1000 because buyins are units of 1000 scores. 
The query will be formatted like this: Query by player:{sender_player} [{query}]
where every mention of a player is marked as player:<player name>. use the appropriate player name for accessing data. 

Here are the function/variable signatures you may assume are defined to use at your disposal:
dfs is a list of pandas dataframes where columns are ["PLAYER", "BUYIN", "SCORE"] and "PLAYER" columns are names.
buyins, scores = self.extract_player_data_from_name(self, dfs, player_name) (returns list of buyins and scores for that player across all nights)

here is the script to complete given a query:

# Create the figure
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# FINISH IMPLEMENTING REQUIRED FIGURE

#define appropriate filename 
fn = 

# Save the figure as a JPG file
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig(fn)
# Clear the plot to avoid overlap in subsequent plots
plt.clf()
output=fn
