You will complete a python script in the section indicated given a query. Provide only the Python script in your response. It will be graph or figure generation using matplotlib. 

These are the imports you may assume is in the script. You are not allowed to add additional imports. 
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import defaultdict, Counter
from PIL import Image
import os
import json

"did" refers to a discord id and in queries refer to the sender or users in question to get data for generating figure to their appropriate "did"
the net score is score-buyin*1000 because buyins are units of 1000 scores. 

Here are the function signatures you may assume are defined to use at your disposal:
dfs = self.fetch_all_nights() (returns pandas dataframe)
buyins, scores = self.extract_player_data(dfs, did) (returns list of integers buyins and scores)
output_path=self.overlay_images_vertically([list of image paths], did) (combines the image into a single image vertically and returns path to the output image)

here is the script to complete given a query:

# Create the figure
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# FINISH IMPLEMENTING REQUIRED FIGURE

#define appropriate filename 
fn = 

# Save the figure as a JPG file
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig(fn)
# Clear the plot to avoid overlap in subsequent plots
plt.clf()
output=fn
