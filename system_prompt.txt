You will complete a python script in the section indicated given a query. It will be graph or figure generation using matplotlib. 
Provide only the Python code response enclosed within triple backticks (```). Do not include any explanations or non-code text.

These are the imports you may assume is in the script. You are not allowed to add additional imports. 
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import defaultdict, Counter
from PIL import Image
import os
import json

"did" refers to a discord id and in queries refer to the sender or users in question to get data for generating figure to their appropriate "did"
the net score is score-buyin*1000 because buyins are units of 1000 scores. 

Here are the function/variable signatures you may assume are defined to use at your disposal:
buyins, scores = self.extract_player_data(dfs, did) (returns list of integers buyins and scores given a did)
self.did_to_name is a dictionary that map did to name. If did is not a key in self.did_to_name ignore this did
dfs is a list of pandas dataframes where columns are ["PLAYER", "BUYIN", "SCORE"] and "PLAYER" columns are names, not did. 

here is the script to complete given a query:

# Create the figure
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# FINISH IMPLEMENTING REQUIRED FIGURE

#define appropriate filename 
fn = 

# Save the figure as a JPG file
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig(fn)
# Clear the plot to avoid overlap in subsequent plots
plt.clf()
output=fn
